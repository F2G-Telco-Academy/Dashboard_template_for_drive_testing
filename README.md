### **Share Workflow**
```
Engineer: Upload CSV → Customize → Click 🔗 SHARE → Copy URL
Client: Open URL → View dashboard (read-only)
```

## 📊 Signal Quality Thresholds (Industry Standard)

| Quality | RSRP Range | Color | Typical Use Case |
|---------|-----------|-------|------------------|
| Excellent | ≥ -80 dBm | 🟢 Green | Dense urban areas |
| Good | -80 to -90 dBm | 🔵 Blue | Suburban coverage |
| Fair | -90 to -100 dBm | 🟡 Yellow | Cell edge, acceptable |
| Poor | -100 to -110 dBm | 🟠 Orange | Coverage holes |
| Very Poor | < -110 dBm | 🔴 Red | Critical weak spots |

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Creating Reusable Templates:
1. Set up your standard test format once
2. Save configuration as template
3. For each new test: Load template → Upload CSV → Edit specific values

### Reset to Default:
- Click **RESET** button to clear all customizations
- Returns dashboard to clean template state
- Clears localStorage cache

---

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

- ✅ **Chrome/Edge** (Recommended - includes "Save As" dialog)
- ✅ **Firefox** (Full functionality)
- ✅ **Safari** (Map rendering may vary slightly)

---

## 🔐 Data Privacy & Security

- **All processing is client-side** (no data sent to servers)
- CSV files never leave your browser
- Configurations stored as local JSON files
- Safe for confidential test data

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see the template placeholders**
- Click the **RESET** button to clear cached data
- Or open in incognito/private window
- Or clear localStorage: F12 → Console → `localStorage.clear()` → Refresh

**Q: My saved config shows default text instead of empty fields**
- This was fixed in latest version
- Re-save your configuration to update format

**Q: Edit mode shows outline but text won't change**
- Make sure edit mode is ON (button should be green)
- Click directly on the text

**Q: Can't choose save location**
- Use Chrome or Edge for "Save As" dialog
- Other browsers use default download folder

**Q: Share URL too long or doesn't work**
- URLs are compressed with gzip (60-80% reduction)
- Use URL shortener if needed for very large datasets
- Ensure CSV file is reasonable size (<5000 points recommended)

**Q: Client view shows error loading configuration**
- Ensure full URL is copied (including ?mode=view&config=...)
- Try opening in different browser
- Check if URL was truncated in email/chat
